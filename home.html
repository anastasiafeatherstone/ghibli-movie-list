              After an encounter with young CGI animators, Miyazaki embarks on a
              new project using these techniques. But the artist, who has been
              adamant about hand-drawn animation, confronts many challenges that
              threaten to cancel the film. Can an old master who thinks he's
              past his prime shine once again? Shot over two years, Never-Ending
              Man: Hayao Miyazaki provides a unique, fascinating glimpse into
              the mind and creative process of one of animation's most iconic
              storytellers.
